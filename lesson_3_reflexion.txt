When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

	To work from multiple computers and/or with multiple collaborators.
  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	To have better control on when changes are publicly available to
others. So they will not be distracted by minor changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

	Forks are copy of remote repositories. Clones are copy to local
repository either from a remote one or from a local one. Branches are
alternative development sequences of changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	This way if you make new commits and merge next, it will be possible
to make fast-forward merges. Because your new commits can reach last known
state of the remote.
